                        Education liberates the intellect, unlocks the imagination and is fundamental for self-respect. It is the key to prosperity and opens a world of opportunities, making it possible for each of us to contribute to a progressive, healthy society. Learning benefits every human being and should be available to all.   - globalgoals.org

                        We believe that there is a lack in quality education in Thailand.  There are an adequate amount of resources , but the problem lies within the distribution and execution of those resources.  The government has made huge investments into education, yet no promising results are shown ( mostly in rural areas or underserved communities ).

                        At the end of lower secondary education, only 46% have a minimum proficiency in mathematics.  As there is a clear scaarcity in STEM education, we would like to make science, technology, engineering & mathematics our main focus for our workshops.
